One resides with Brother Mason. One is behind the Skull of St. Yora.  One is in the kitchen, by the oven.  One is behind the rack which loosens men's tongues. One is behind the Keystone Tree.  The locks must be released within the span of five minutes; when all of the locks are released, the Talisman Cage can be opened.  Then, he who removes the Talisman must first recite the Prayer of the Wallbuilder."
