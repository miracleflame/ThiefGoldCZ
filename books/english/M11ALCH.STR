convert the unused storage room in the winter tunnels into an alchemy laboratory.  \
This day my research hath yielded much, as I have created a most useful explosive \
device.  It is my belief that in times of war we will be able to use such explosives \
to force open the gates of the strongholds of our foes.  The device is quite \
dangerous, so I have stored it in the armory in the cathedral attic."
