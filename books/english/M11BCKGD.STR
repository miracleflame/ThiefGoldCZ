and mine mortal life, I shall faithfully chronicle to the end.   A great evil \
magic hath befallen us, and we battle with demon-kind on all sides.  Our own fallen \
brethren rise from death and turn on us, cold light aflame in their eyes.  Our mighty \
doors availed us naught, for the assault was from within. Soon I shall be found and \
slain, like the others.  May The Builder save our souls."
