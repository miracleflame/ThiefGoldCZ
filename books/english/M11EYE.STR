     The behavior we hath \
repeatedly seen exhibited is truly most \
troublesome.  The Eye hath been moved once \
again to the vault in the cellar.  This eve, \
please you post two sentinels to guard \
it.  Thus we shall determine how it is \
that we find it floating o'er the high altar each morn."
