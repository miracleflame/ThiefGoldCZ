walking therein, but upon investigating found that the apparition had vanished.  Those \
who heard his story laughed and blamed his vision on an excess of ale, but I am not so \
quick to dismiss it.  I remember the burial of our beloved Brother Murus last week and \
the feeling that something was wrong.  I shan't relate the story to Brother Martello, \
since he was much attached to Brother Murus, and mourns his loss still."
