You are my number one man. I trusted you to select my personal staff and you have witnessed for each and every one of them. I've also trusted you with the only key to my mansion because of your unmatched loyalty.  But don’t think that my faith in you means that I will ignore your responsibilities. Consider this a friendly reminder...
If Donal's people get into my home and get the key to his Master Safe, YOU ARE ACCOUNTABLE! And you know I always collect my debts.
