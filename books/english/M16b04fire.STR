Lt. Scarle disobeyed Capt. Regalio’s specific orders and ventured into the Tower of Fire.  Needless to say he was ill prepared to deal with the trials of flame and lava that await all entrants.  The charred corpse was brought to the laboratories where it will be put to good use.  The fire can cleanse us, but it is not for the Commons. See to it that this incident serves as an example to others.
