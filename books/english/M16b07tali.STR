- Due to a disastrous experiment by Archmage Jabu Ibn Lani the Water Tower will be closed until further notice due to flooding.  All future experiments using water elementals are forbidden by mutual consent of the Inner Circle until we can devise stronger wards. 

- Our keep must remain unified and maintain tradition. Each Tower holds the key of another to maintain the Doctrine of Trust. Since the key to the Tower of Water was lost controlling the accident, the fire mages have no symbol to guard."
