The workmen have finally cleared out, having just finished walling up the last main entrance to those infernal sewers.  The old sewers are still largely unmapped, but present too much of a security risk to be left.  I find it amazing that they reach back to the city despite our distance from it.  There is still the one secret entrance that we can use to traverse the sewers.  The guards that patrol it will deal with anything unfortunate enough to struggle out of that muck.
