Listen well, oh novice, to the lore of your elders.  The Ritual of Opening shows the way and the true path.  We use the ritual as the ceremonial guide for all our work.  The guarding wards and our wondrous towers all lock using this, the natural order of the elements.  
 
The Ritual of Opening
Dark waters surged flooding the world as they bore life,  
Hard earth then rose giving substance and strife, 
Storm breath blew binding the land in halos of wrath
Last came raging flames cleansing minds for the final path.
