A stellar performance as usual. \

I write in hopes that you will consent to a stroll \

this evening on the 2nd floor promenade. \

I promise I will not arrive empty handed. \

Please do not refuse me, I will wait all night \

if need be.  A short stroll and some pleasant \

conversation is all I ask, and in return \

I have for you a most special gift - \

one fit for a queen. \

Awaiting you on the promenade, \

I remain, \

Your most ardent admirer, \

Lord B."
