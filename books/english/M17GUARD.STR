Page_0: "Captain Colliard and men of the Opera Guard - \

\

Two guards will at all times, day and night, \

be posted outside my office suite. \

In case of trouble or commotion of any kind \

in the opera house, then send two more \

to stand guard directly inside the suite. \

The artifact must be protected. \

I will tolerate no lapses in security. \
