She doesn’t know about the secret passageway that leads there from the 2nd floor rotunda. She doesn’t know about the key that works the lock. When she took over here and dismissed my whole staff, all knowledge of the secret passages and rooms left with us. I return here now and then to obtain provisions, always with the thought of exacting some revenge - but I fear I carry with me a terrible flaw - I do not have revenge in my blood. 

-Raoul."
