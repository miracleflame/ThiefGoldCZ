These are great times for thinkers such \

as ourselves.  I am certain that the secrets \

of the artifact will soon be mine.  With its \

powers, and the power unleashed by your music, \

I am more and more convinced that our day is near. \

Please accept this flute as a token of my \

continued appreciation.  Appreciation for our \

special friendship, and for your tireless \

dedication to the opera. \

Yours always - Lady Valerius"
