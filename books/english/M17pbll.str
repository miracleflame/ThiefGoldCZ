I have received word of the \

shrine and treasure room you have \

found during your mission to \

eradicate our little spider problem. \

I look forward to receiving \

whatever bounty lies there, and \

will not tolerate any more excuses \

about mysterious traps or other \

dangers. \

Success - Lady V."
