Page_0: "It appears I was wrong about the Mystic's Heart, and I will \
die for my mistake.  The ancient tablet I found said that the Heart would \
be in \"a room of statues, whose gaze is death,\" but though there are \
statues here, it's clear to me now that this is not that place.  I dare not \
go back down -- the burricks prowl below in numbers, angered at my intrustion. \
Unless they leave, I will starve in this Godforsaken place."
