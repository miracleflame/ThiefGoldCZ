has been here before us.  I don't know if he found that fabulous gemstone he \
always said was here, but if it's still here, it's worth more than the lousy \
Horn of Quintuplets, or whatever the thing is called.  If I'm reading the \
signs right, Adolpho was convinced something useful was deep down below the \
Burrick tunnels."
