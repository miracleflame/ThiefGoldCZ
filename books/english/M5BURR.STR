If I visit with my babies and again find that \
they have not been fed properly, I shall take \
the horsewhip to the lot of you!  The poor \
dears must be given live food - their delicate \
stomachs cannot abide the smell of carrion!  \
I am in no mood to hear of the shortages when \
my babies are starving."
