While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I must point \
out that breaking legs is, really, rather inefficient, \
if we wish our clients to be able to pursue their \
rather active lives in order to immediately repay \
their debts.  I encourage your initiative in this \
area - perhaps you might take a lesson from the \
gardener and his hedge clippers, who trims off one \
branch while leaving the rest to grow... and most \
of our clients do start with fingers to spare. "
