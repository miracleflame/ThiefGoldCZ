page_0: "THE CITY TRIBUNE

A woman from Shalebridge who was acquitted of charges of robbery in a city court last \
week has been kidnapped by members of the Order of the Hammer.  The woman is apparently \
being held in squalid conditions in Cragscleft prison.  Whereas the Hammerites did not \
cite any official reason for the incarceration, one of the Order was quoted, saying, \
\"She hath sinned in The Builder's eyes, and thy slothful laws hath touched her not at all.\""
