Tatyana's Flowers

These flowers grow primarily in the icy mountain caves of the Esse range.  By way of \
defense, they have evolved a method of warming and swirling the magical energy of the \
sentient plants and rocks discussed in the last chapter, lulling them to sleep.  The \
flowers are named after archemage Tatyana Yokobik who pioneered their use in the \
temporary negation of magical spells and systems."
