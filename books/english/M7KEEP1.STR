        We have received word of your fears, and we understand and indeed share them. We did not lightly take the decision to involve ourselves in this matter.  However, we believe that we were compelled to act.  Were the Trickster not opposed, he could bring destruction upon the entire city, and upon us as well.  We have endeavored to conceal our efforts as best we can.  I can only hope that we have been successful.  
        Yours in knowledge,
        Keeper Andrus"
