        We are relieved to hear that you have successfully contained the destruction.  It was for just such a contingency that the Elemental Wards have been saved these many years, and we support your decision to use them now, as the peril that you have described is grave indeed.  We urge you to hide the Talismans with great care, as their discovery could lead to another such catastrophe.  We worry also that your actions have exposed the truth of our existence to the world, which we must not allow. 
        Yours in knowledge,
        Keeper Lukas"
