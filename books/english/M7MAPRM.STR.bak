The Portal Key in the library must be used to access the Lost City entrance where the Talisman of Fire is being kept. The Water Talisman has been hidden in a shrine located in the 

caverns below the old quarter of 
the city. The Talisman of Air is 
being kept by the Hammerites, and 
the Earth Talisman was left to 
the Hand Brotherhood."
