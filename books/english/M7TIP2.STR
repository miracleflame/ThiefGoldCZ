and the slain.  The well-prepared knight will arm himself well with \
holy water.  However, \
a more convenient tactic, as well as one much less taxing on the purse, is \
to take advantage of the zombie's antipathy for all living creatures, \
and look for other convenient targets to divert a pursuer.
