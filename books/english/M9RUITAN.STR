to the Guild of Enlightenment.

The priests tell the ignorant that the earth \
is crying for her departed brother, Va-Taraq.  \
We know that these tremors signify something \
more ominous.  Taraq would have listened to \
us and evacuated the city, but his son is \
less enlightened.  The Guild must protect \
what we can, by whatever magical and mundane \
means we posses. The tower must not fall."
