Let me know if you ever come across any good antiquities in \
your, ah, explorations.  I'd be particularly interested in any \
ritual headresses and masks.   The gold and enamel work from \
Cyric is increasingly rare, and I needn't point out that if \
you ever found something dating back to the Precursors, I'd \
make you a rich man.
