earth, and filled with all manner of things \
which are pleasing to serve him in his nether \
days.  Splendor shall follow our beloved \
monarch to mark his glory.  And woe to those \
who would disturb his sleep!  They shall be \
imperiled from below, from above and from \
that which is directly before their eyes."
