1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,500
The essence of balance is detachment. 

2
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:16,001
To embrace a cause, to grow fond or spiteful, 

3
00:00:16,502 --> 00:00:21,002
is to lose one's balance, 

4
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:26,003
after which, no action can be trusted. 

5
00:00:26,804 --> 00:00:31,504
Our burden is not for the dependent of spirit.

6
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:34,305
-- Mayar, Third Keeper

7
00:00:37,106 --> 00:00:38,506
I was a, kid.

8
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:40,607
No parents, no home... 

9
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:43,408
Running messages and picking pockets to keep...

10
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:45,409
...my ribs from meeting my spine. 

11
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,510
One night I saw a man.

12
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,511
Folks just passed him by like he wasn't there.

13
00:00:49,812 --> 00:00:54,112
I thought he must have something valuable, so I snuck up on him and made a grab.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,900
- That's not for you.

15
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:01,501
- Please, sir, I'm hungry. 

16
00:01:01,502 --> 00:01:03,154
Don't tell the Hammers. I promise--.

17
00:01:03,303 --> 00:01:06,113
- What is your name, boy?
- Garrett.

18
00:01:06,214 --> 00:01:08,114
- You have talent, lad.

19
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:10,115
- Let go of me, old man!

20
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:12,416
- To see a Keeper is not an easy thing, 

21
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:15,317
...especially one who does not wish to be seen.

22
00:01:16,318 --> 00:01:18,818
We have a need for those as gifted as yourself.

23
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,819
If you've grown tired of how you live, then follow me, 

24
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,220
...and we will show you a different way.

25
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:28,321
- Leave me alone!
- As you wish.

26
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,222
I caught up with him just before he vanished into the crowd..

27
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:34,623
It was the beginning of a very long education.
