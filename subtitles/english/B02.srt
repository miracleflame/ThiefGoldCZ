1
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,100
The most promising acolyte left us, 

2
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:34,801
not out of the lesser folly of sentiment,

3
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,602
but the greater folly of anger. 

4
00:00:39,503 --> 00:00:42,603
His heart was clouded, and his balance was lost,

5
00:00:42,704 --> 00:00:45,804
but his abilities were unmatched.

6
00:00:45,905 --> 00:00:51,006
Even then, we knew to watch him most carefully.

7
00:00:51,707 --> 00:00:53,707
-- Keeper Annals

8
00:01:02,408 --> 00:01:05,008
I have a simple job planned for this evening. 

9
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,109
Break into a guarded mansion,

10
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,210
steal another fat nobleman's priceless trinket, 

11
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:11,211
and leave quietly.

12
00:01:11,312 --> 00:01:13,212
Lord Bafford is out of town,

13
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:16,913
and rumour has it that the captain of his house guard went with him, as a bodyguard.

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,600
The time is ripe for a bit of burglary.

15
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,100
The front gate of Lord Bafford's manor is always guarded,

16
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:30,101
and the main street is far too exposed.

17
00:01:30,702 --> 00:01:33,702
But Cutty tells me there's a better way in,

18
00:01:33,703 --> 00:01:36,203
around to the side, more 'out of the way'.

19
00:01:36,204 --> 00:01:38,704
One guard, and likely no
witnesses to...

20
00:01:38,705 --> 00:01:40,705
...complicate matters.

21
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:45,706
The piece Cutty wants is a sceptre:

22
00:01:45,707 --> 00:01:47,907
silver, jewels...the usual adornments.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,208
It should command a high price.

24
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:53,209
Bafford, like most of his kind,

25
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,210
probably keeps his treasures on the top floor of the place,

26
00:01:56,211 --> 00:02:00,211
close to his heart, and far from his servants.

27
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,600
No point in waiting.

28
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:07,701
I have Cutty's old sketches of the place,

29
00:02:07,802 --> 00:02:10,302
and everyone who's going to be asleep inside already is.

30
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:12,803
It's time to begin.
