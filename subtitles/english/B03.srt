1
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,800
Before death came,

2
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,601
the liars were made to feast...

3
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,602
upon the hands of the thieves,

4
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:40,303
and the thieves were made to ingest...

5
00:00:40,504 --> 00:00:42,604
the tongues of their liar brothers,

6
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:45,405
and we praised the Master Builder for his judgements.

7
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:47,406
--The Hammer Book of Tenets

8
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:51,407
I went to Cutty's place to deliver the scepter,

9
00:00:51,408 --> 00:00:52,908
but Cutty wasn't there. 

10
00:00:53,209 --> 00:00:55,309
He'd been arrested by the Hammerites.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,100
Apparently they didn't approve of his occupation,

12
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:00,611
and I doubt they approve of mine.

13
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:03,112
So hopefully they'll never catch sight of me

14
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:07,313
when I break him out of their prison. Which is what I'm going to do.

15
00:01:08,514 --> 00:01:12,414
They're holding Cutty in a mining complex carved out of a quarry.

16
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:14,515
The quarry's flooded, but the Hammers

17
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:16,516
still work the top level mines, 

18
00:01:16,517 --> 00:01:19,417
and have converted part of the complex into a penitentiary for those who...

19
00:01:19,918 --> 00:01:22,118
"violate" their tenets.

20
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,219
An associate of mine was confined there, and has provided me with a map.

21
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,800
It would be difficult to get in by way of the main gate, but there is another option.

22
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,801
The mines break the surface of a hill south of the quarry.

23
00:01:36,902 --> 00:01:39,502
I'll drop into the mines and head for the prison,

24
00:01:39,503 --> 00:01:42,203
which will be found somewhere uphill and to the north.

25
00:01:42,704 --> 00:01:45,204
The Hammers don't venture into these lower mine levels

26
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,005
because they're reputed to be haunted.

27
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:50,006
I'd rather not have to do this job,

28
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:51,807
but Cutty's a reliable fence,

29
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:55,208
and I don't appreciate the Hammerites abducting him. 

30
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:58,709
And he owes me money for the Bafford job.
