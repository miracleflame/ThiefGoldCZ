1
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:21,400
...And the manfools piled rock on rocks and raised a treesie roof,

2
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:25,401
hammers saws tear the skin of goodsie wood...

3
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:29,502
..and laughs at the Woodsie Lord.

4
00:00:29,903 --> 00:00:35,803
...And when learns the Lord of this, He sends His beastesses to the manfools....

5
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,604
...who attacks and hammers saws their use-less fleshes, 

6
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:43,205
and build him a house of they rotting skins.

7
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:45,206
-- Unattributed Trickster song

8
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,807
I was pissed at Cutty for a good while after the...

9
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:51,408
...prison debacle.

10
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:54,909
But hey, you can't blame him for what the Hammers did to him.

11
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,710
So I decided to go after that horn Felix talked about.

12
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:01,311
Not like I had a whole lot of choice, really...

13
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:02,812
...the rent is due...

14
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,613
and my landlord's even tougher than the Hammers.

15
00:01:05,854 --> 00:01:09,054
The map's pretty specific about where the entrance is.

16
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:12,355
Too bad it's not as clear about where the Horn is.

17
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:14,956
Felix did some scrounging before he left,

18
00:01:14,957 --> 00:01:17,957
and his notes say the horn is in the tomb of some nobles...

19
00:01:18,258 --> 00:01:20,758
...the Quintus family.

20
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,259
Guess I'll just have to explore.

21
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,760
Felix, always helpful, also said that the catacombs

22
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:29,661
are supposed to be haunted.

23
00:01:29,662 --> 00:01:31,762
Think I'll go make some inquiries about 

24
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:34,463
where a heretic like me can get some holy water.

25
00:01:35,764 --> 00:01:37,764
Always go prepared.
