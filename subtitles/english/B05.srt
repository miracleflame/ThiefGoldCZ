1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,600
The ancient corruption was again contained.

2
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:15,901
To do more would have upset the balance,

3
00:00:15,902 --> 00:00:19,902
but we knew to remain ever vigilant lest it resurface. 

4
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:27,203
Neither the Hammers nor the pagans could be trusted not to meddle.

5
00:00:27,704 --> 00:00:29,604
-- Keeper Annals

6
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:33,205
I had some money to spare after disposing of the Horn,

7
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:35,606
so it seemed time to invest in some new...  

8
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:37,207
...tools.

9
00:00:37,808 --> 00:00:39,908
Farkus is one of the few merchants willing to risk 

10
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,909
selling to an independent like me,

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,610
and his prices are steep...

12
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,711
but the other choice is to let one of the so-called 

13
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,812
"City Wardens" give me orders...

14
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:49,713
...And take a cut of my profits. 

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,500
They'd been after me for years to

16
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:54,415
join one of their stables, but I'm not interested.

17
00:00:54,716 --> 00:00:56,916
Maybe they'll get the idea and give up. 

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,600
More likely they'll just ramp up the threats.

19
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:03,501
Nothing I can't handle if I'm careful.

20
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,110
And lucky.

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,050
And my luck seems to have finally turned for the better.
