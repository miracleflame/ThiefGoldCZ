1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,300
Builds your roofs of dead wood. 

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,000
Builds your walls of dead stone. 

3
00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:15,902
Builds your dreams of dead thoughts.

4
00:00:16,204 --> 00:00:19,004
Comes crying laughing singing back to life,

5
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:21,005
takes what you steal, 

6
00:00:21,506 --> 00:00:26,306
and pulls the skins from your dead bones shrieking.

7
00:00:27,107 --> 00:00:29,257
-- Clay tablet in an abandoned Trickster temple

8
00:00:30,808 --> 00:00:33,408
I was contacted by a woman named Viktoria.

9
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:35,909
She claims to represent a client who was impressed

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,310
by the way I took care of Ramirez,

11
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:40,511
and now wants me to steal something for him.

12
00:00:41,712 --> 00:00:43,912
The target is a magical sword, 

13
00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:47,413
owned by a nobleman and collector named Constantine..

14
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,614
Little is known about Constantine

15
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:53,615
except that he is an eccentric new face in this city,

16
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,116
and mostly keeps to himself.

17
00:00:57,617 --> 00:01:01,317
Viktoria says the sword will probably be on display,

18
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:05,118
but it will be well protected by guards and security systems. 

19
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,619
She also mentioned that the guards are tough and organized,

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,820
and the mansion is confusing to navigate in.

21
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:14,721
The house was constructed recently,

22
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:17,222
so I've had to piece together my own map

23
00:01:17,223 --> 00:01:19,323
from observation and hearsay.

24
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:22,124
Sounds like the place is a bit of a maze.

25
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:24,025
I guess if you're rich enough

26
00:01:24,026 --> 00:01:26,626
you can build any sort of madhouse to live in.

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,400
This is going to be a challenging job,

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,050
but it will pay better than the last few I've taken.

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,900
As usual, the front entrance is heavily guarded,

30
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:40,601
but I've managed to find another way in.

31
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,102
'Course once I've picked up the sword

32
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,003
I'll still have to worry about getting back out.
