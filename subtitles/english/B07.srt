1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,200
Come the time of peril, did the ground gape,

2
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:15,301
and did the dead rest unquiet 'gainst us. 

3
00:00:16,202 --> 00:00:20,202
Our bands of iron and hammers of stone prevailed not, 

4
00:00:21,203 --> 00:00:24,803
and some did doubt the Builder's plan.

5
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:29,204
But the seals held strong, and the few did triumph,

6
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:33,805
and the doubters were lain into the foundations of the new sanctum.

7
00:00:34,206 --> 00:00:36,506
-- Collected letters of the smith-in-exile.

8
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:40,007
The Eye that Constantine wants

9
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:42,408
is in the abandoned cathedral of the Hammerites.

10
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,509
The cathedral is located in the section of the city

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,510
that was deserted years ago, after some kind of catastrophe. 

12
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:53,711
I've heard stories of the incident,

13
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:57,512
most are wild rumours about hordes of zombies

14
00:00:57,513 --> 00:00:58,913
and raging fires.

15
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:02,214
Now that part of the city is walled off,

16
00:01:02,215 --> 00:01:04,115
no one's allowed to go in.

17
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:07,416
Not that many people would dare to in the first place.

18
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:10,417
Maps of the area are easy to find,

19
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:13,818
in attics, and old trunks, but like all of them,

20
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:16,519
the one I've got is over fifty years old.

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,320
I'll make my way through the ruins to the Hammerite cathedral,

22
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:22,421
and find a way inside.

23
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:26,322
Once I get inside the cathedral, I'll have to locate The Eye.

24
00:01:28,123 --> 00:01:30,923
Something tells me that this is not going to be easy.

25
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,724
But for the amount I'm getting paid,

26
00:01:34,024 --> 00:01:36,424
I'm willing to take some serious risks.
