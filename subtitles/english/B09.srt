1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,100
The knowledge of those who came before could neither be disseminated or destroyed. 

2
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:20,201
Its power would be a dangerous tool in the wrong hands, 

3
00:00:20,802 --> 00:00:25,402
but would also insure against future cataclysm. 

4
00:00:26,103 --> 00:00:33,303
At that time we chose to maintain it with writings preserved in extant locations.

5
00:00:33,704 --> 00:00:35,704
-- Keeper Annals

6
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:40,405
The Keepers have hidden the Talisman of Fire  

7
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:43,106
in a place they call "The Lost City".

8
00:00:43,507 --> 00:00:47,107
Some kind of cataclysm buried the place underground ages ago.

9
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:50,408
The Keepers have sealed the access to the city,

10
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,509
a cleft in the river bottom near the east side.

11
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,110
If the materials in the library are right,

12
00:00:56,211 --> 00:01:00,111
the strange stone I found can be used to open that seal.

13
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:03,212
I've also got a map,

14
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:06,413
it's so old the edges crumble in my hands.

15
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:11,014
It shows the city, or at least how it was back then.

16
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:14,815
I hope the old place hasn't changed much.
