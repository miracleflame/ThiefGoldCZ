1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,400
Having pledged our honour as shield over Air, we must be mindful. 

2
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:19,402
Let it be locked away and safe, but ever in view of the faithful. 

3
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,703
Future generations are hostage to our care.

4
00:00:23,504 --> 00:00:25,404
-- Hammerite Sermon of the Talisman

5
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:30,805
Getting the Talisman of Air will be an interesting challenge,

6
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:34,906
but I'll need it if I want to get "The Eye" for Constantine.

7
00:00:35,107 --> 00:00:38,307
It's well hidden inside the city's Hammer Temple,

8
00:00:38,408 --> 00:00:40,708
so I'll have to do some scouting around. 

9
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,809
Problem is the place is fully active,

10
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,210
day and night,

11
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:49,311
not even I could stay undetected for very long.

12
00:00:50,612 --> 00:00:52,812
Well they say that the best place to hide a letter

13
00:00:52,813 --> 00:00:54,613
is on the mantlepiece.

14
00:00:54,914 --> 00:00:57,814
With that in mind I'll be going in by the front door,

15
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:00,315
dressed as a Hammerite Novice.

16
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,816
That should be perfect since Novices aren't allowed to speak

17
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:06,017
while on the Temple grounds..

18
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:09,318
My contacts can get me a Novice's pass

19
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,019
o get me through the gate.

20
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,720
Once inside I'll be free to take my time,

21
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:17,821
explore the place thoroughly, and find the Talisman,

22
00:01:18,922 --> 00:01:21,122
as long as I don't do anything violent,

23
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:24,023
or get caught somewhere I shouldn't be.

24
00:01:24,624 --> 00:01:26,424
Because as the new arrival

25
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:30,025
I'll be the first person they suspect if anything goes wrong.
