00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,000
And he did say, "Shall we not use this power, as our enemies used it unto us?

2
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:20,001
Do we not carve their wild forests into our beams and boards? 

3
00:00:20,602 --> 00:00:26,002
Do we not tame their raging streams to carry our boats?" 

4
00:00:26,603 --> 00:00:31,003
And in their youth and fool- ishness, did his brothers say, "Yes, let us."

5
00:00:31,104 --> 00:00:33,604
-- Collected letters of the smith-in-exile

6
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:39,205
With the Talismans, I'll be able to break the wards on the Cathedral.

7
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,806
It's time for me to retrieve "The Eye" and bring it to Constantine.

8
00:00:43,307 --> 00:00:48,707
Last time I was here, "The Eye" was inside, in plain sight on the main altar.

9
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,308
I just have to grab it, and leave. 

10
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,609
But that won't necessarily be easy if the place is as

11
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,410
haunted as it looked before. 

12
00:00:56,711 --> 00:00:59,911
So if things get tough, there is another way out,

13
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:03,612
throught the gate in the Cloister, behind the Cathedral.

14
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:07,513
The sooner this ordeal is over with, the better.

15
00:01:07,714 --> 00:01:12,514
When I get paid for this job, I'm gonna retire in style.
