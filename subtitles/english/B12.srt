1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,100
Danced we in joys and triumphs. 

2
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:12,201
With us the Woodsie Lord danced the stringsie foolsie man 

3
00:00:13,402 --> 00:00:20,802
Rose the storms in shouty glee, the darkness in feary glooms, the fires in happy greed. 

4
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:29,503
Danced we away, and fed the sad stringsie man- fool to their devourings for our thanks.

-- Final fragment of the "Notyets" manuscript

6
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:36,305
- This way?

7
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:38,806
- Look here. Our path is true.

8
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,707
- In here?
- Yes.

9
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:49,308
- Since you left us, you've been a stone rolling downhill.

10
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:53,309
Now you must aim this remarkable momentum.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,600
It is past time for the balance to shift.

12
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,100
- They come.

13
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:03,001
- Wha--? Wait!

14
00:01:03,902 --> 00:01:06,902
- The Trickster will not forgive you for doing what he could not.

15
00:01:07,403 --> 00:01:09,803
Nor, I trust, will you forgive us.

16
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:11,404
- Keepers.

17
00:01:13,205 --> 00:01:15,205
Looks like I'd better get moving,

18
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:18,206
or whatever those things are will waste a perfectly good rescue.
