1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,600
The stone cannot know why the chisel cleaves it; 

2
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:16,701
the iron cannot know why the fire scorches it. 

3
00:00:17,502 --> 00:00:20,502
When thy life is cleft and scorched, 

4
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:23,503
when death and despair leap at thee,

5
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:27,903
beat not thy breast and curse thy evil fate, 

6
00:00:28,804 --> 00:00:32,804
but thank the Builder for the trials that shape thee.

7
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:34,905
-- The Hammer Book of Tenets

8
00:00:36,606 --> 00:00:39,506
This was not the way things were supposed to go.

9
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:43,607
Constantine has the Eye...and my eye...

10
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:47,108
and I doubt he has anything wholesome planned for it.

11
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:50,109
The Trickster is real after all.

12
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,710
I don't think anyone but those crazy Hammers

13
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:54,711
really believed in the old gods.

14
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:57,312
Those crazy Hammers.

15
00:00:57,913 --> 00:01:01,013
You know, it wouldn't hurt to have a few dozen

16
00:01:01,014 --> 00:01:03,514
heavily-armed fanatics on MY side just about now. 

17
00:01:03,915 --> 00:01:06,715
If I drop by their temple and explain things,

18
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:10,216
maybe they'll be so distracted by the Trickster's return

19
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:12,317
that they'll forget to hold a grudge.

20
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:14,618
And even if they don't,

21
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:18,219
I know how to get out of Cragscleft prison already.
