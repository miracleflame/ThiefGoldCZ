1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,000
The weights in each pan of the balance had increased greatly. 

2
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:19,001
As he approached his triumph, our foe had made himself vulnerable. 

3
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:25,002
We were unable to directly influence, and could only watch and wait

4
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:31,003
to see whether his pridefully chosen pawn would prove his undoing.

5
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:32,704
-- Keeper Annals

6
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:36,505
Well, this is it.

7
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:39,806
The Hammers say they've received word that Constantine's

8
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:43,307
descended into his realm, to perform a ritual with the Eye.

9
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:47,308
The Hammers have built me a booby-trapped, counterfeit Eye,

10
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:52,209
If I can swap it for the real thing, it should cause him some trouble.

11
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,310
If he doesn't notice me.

12
00:00:56,111 --> 00:01:00,211
I've never robbed a god before. It'll be a challenge.
