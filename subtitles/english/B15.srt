1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,000
In the beginning we lived as thieves, 

2
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:13,601
Stealing fur and fang of beasts for survival

3
00:00:15,302 --> 00:00:19,502
Then came the Builder who brought us the Hammer, 

4
00:00:21,203 --> 00:00:25,403
And with it we forged a new way of life. 

5
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:30,004
To reject the Hammer is to denounce the Builder.

6
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:31,805
-- The Hammer Book of Tenets

7
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:37,306
I was going to pay Lord Randall and his vase collection a visit,

8
00:00:37,307 --> 00:00:41,507
but the Downwind Thieves' Guild beat me to the score.

9
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,508
Word is that they haven't divvied the booty yet. 

10
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:48,009
Apparently their leaders...Donal and Reuben...

11
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,010
...are arguing over the prized sapphire vase.

12
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:53,711
Sounds like they could use a third party

13
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:55,112
to settle their disagreement.

14
00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:59,813
Since I'm no mediator, I'll just steal the vase from them.

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,414
They'll be so busy blaming each other

16
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:04,715
no one will suspect an outsider.

17
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:09,016
The Downwinders run a gambling den called the "Overlord's Fancy,"

18
00:01:09,217 --> 00:01:11,517
which operates under a nearby restaurant.

19
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:14,318
The guild's hideout is beneath the casino.

20
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,419
I have a rough map of the complex I got from...

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,120
..sources from the inside.

22
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:21,521
Once I'm in the Overlord's Fancy

23
00:01:21,622 --> 00:01:24,622
I'll have to search for the secret entrance to the hideout.

24
00:01:24,923 --> 00:01:29,023
Have to be careful, the Downwinder's know me all too well.

25
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:32,524
If they catch sight of me they'll know who took the vase.

26
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:35,925
Assuming they don't just kill me for trespassing.

27
00:01:38,026 --> 00:01:40,326
Finding the vase may prove difficult,

28
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:42,927
since I have no idea where it is.

29
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,628
Should be a hot topic of conversation among the Downwinders.

30
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:50,629
Maybe I'll be lucky enough to overhear where they're stashing it.

31
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,930
Time to make a living.
