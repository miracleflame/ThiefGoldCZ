1
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,500
From unknown origins they came

2
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,201
They live isolated beyond the city

3
00:00:16,702 --> 00:00:19,902
The extent of their arcane power is unknown

4
00:00:21,403 --> 00:00:24,803
We must be very cautious in dealing with them

5
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:28,304
Close observation must continue

6
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:30,405
-- Keeper Xavier, Treatise on Mages

7
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:34,806
The Talisman of Earth is guarded by a foreign mages' sect

8
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:37,207
known as the "Hand Brotherhood". 

9
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,208
They reside in a compound of huge towers,

10
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:44,309
where they practice their arts of
Earth, Air, Fire, and Water.

11
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,010
The Talisman is likely kept in the Earth tower, 

12
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:50,811
but there's little chance it'll be that simple.

13
00:00:51,212 --> 00:00:53,312
No doubt the Talisman is heavily guarded

14
00:00:53,313 --> 00:00:55,513
and probably protected by magic. 

15
00:00:56,614 --> 00:00:59,414
But mages love to write everything down...

16
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:03,715
I should "stumble" on something useful about their precious trinket.

17
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:07,616
I bribed some servants to get me a map of the common grounds...

18
00:01:07,617 --> 00:01:10,917
...the best I could do since only the mages are allowed in the towers.

19
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:14,618
I'll enter the courtyard just outside the central keep entrance.
 
20
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,519
Once inside I'll need to move quickly to find the Talisman.

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,920
I wouldn't last long in a fight against the mages.
