Blindness is the manfools 

2
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:12,401
theys gathers up treasures and greeders themselves on gold rocks and fetters

3
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:17,202
The Woodsie One wreaks thems with lilacs and nettles  

4
00:00:18,203 --> 00:00:20,803
and gathers theys bones for His porridge and feathers.

6
00:00:23,305 --> 00:00:25,505
The Keepers stashed the Talisman of Water 

7
00:00:25,506 --> 00:00:29,106
in a series of hidden caverns located deep below the city. 

8
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:32,507
According to their map I'll find it in a shrine

9
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:34,508
located in the lowest cavern.

10
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:37,509
I don't expect to run into anything too threatening

11
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,610
other than a few venemous spiders,

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,600
however the map does contain this note:

13
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:46,201
"Stand not against us, lest you feel

14
00:00:46,202 --> 00:00:49,002
the sting of ignorance's barbs."

15
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:53,203
Heh...sounds like Keeper talk for "We've rigged the place".

16
00:00:54,904 --> 00:00:59,014
An informant of mine, Giry, made a home for himself in these caverns

17
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:01,415
after he lost his job tending the ticket counter

18
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,416
of a nearby opera house.

19
00:01:04,317 --> 00:01:06,417
He should know these caverns better than anyone,

20
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:10,618
so I'll pay him a visit, to see if he has any useful information for me.
