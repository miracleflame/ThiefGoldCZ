1
00:00:05,408 --> 00:00:08,008
I have a simple job planned for this evening.

2
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,109
Break into a guarded mansion,

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,210
steal another fat nobleman's priceless trinket,

4
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:14,211
and leave quietly.

5
00:00:15,012 --> 00:00:17,212
Lord Bafford is out of town,

6
00:00:17,213 --> 00:00:20,913
and rumour has it that the captain of his house guard went with him, as a bodyguard.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,600
The time is ripe for a bit of burglary.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,100
The front gate of Lord Bafford's manor is always guarded,

9
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:32,101
and the main street is far too exposed. 

10
00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:35,702
But Cutty tells me there's a better way in,

11
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:38,203
around to the side, more out of the way.

12
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:41,704
One guard, and likely no witnesses to...

13
00:00:41,705 --> 00:00:42,705
...complicate matters.

14
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:48,706
The piece Cutty wants is a scepter,

15
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:50,907
silver, jewels, the usual adornments.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,208
It should command a high price.

17
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:56,209
Bafford, like most of his kind,

18
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,210
probably keeps his treasures on the top floor of the place.

19
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:02,211
Close to his heart, and far from his servants.

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,600
No point in waiting.

21
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,701
I have Cutty's old sketches of the place,

22
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:12,302
and everyone
who's going to be asleep inside already is.

23
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:15,803
It's time to begin.
