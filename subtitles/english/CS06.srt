1
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,000
- Garrett? It's Viktoria.

2
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:25,701
I trust you made it back alive?

3
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:30,602
You've done well, Garrett. Come with me, and bring the sword.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,200
There is someone you have to meet. It's time for the payment you've been promised.

5
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:38,801
- Yes.

6
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:48,802
- A refreshment, Mister Garrett?

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm in the possession of a superior
brandy, that has the most...

8
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,600
..."restorative" effect.

9
00:00:55,701 --> 00:01:00,201
- I prefer my payment in cash, not liquor, Mister...ahh...

10
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,000
- My apologies.

11
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,600
I've been watching you, Mister Garrett. So closely, in fact,

12
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:08,901
that I'm afraid I'd forgotten we haven't actually met yet.

13
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,150
I am...Constantine.

14
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,450
- All this time I thought you were going to pay me.

15
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,700
You've brought me here to kill me?

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,301
- But you have it all wrong, Mister Garrett.

17
00:01:19,302 --> 00:01:23,402
Would it surprise you to know that it was I who hired you to steal my own sword?

18
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes. You see, Viktoria and I are...
19
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:29,801
- Old associates.

20
00:01:29,902 --> 00:01:33,202
- Yes. You were being tested. Do you understand?

21
00:01:33,703 --> 00:01:36,903
And I must say, you more than live up to your reputation.

22
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:39,904
You are quite an extraordinary thief.

23
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:44,205
- Testing me? What is it you want from me, Constantine?

24
00:01:44,506 --> 00:01:48,806
- I am a collector, Mister Garrett. But there are some 'items',

25
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:51,007
that are not available for purchase.

26
00:01:51,108 --> 00:01:53,808
They must be acquired using other means.

27
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,909
In this case the item in question would be best acquired by thieving.

28
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,710
Not simple thieving...no. I need an artist. Like yourself.

29
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:07,011
- What exactly IS this...item?

30
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:11,612
- It is the gemstone called The Eye, for it's unusual...

31
00:02:11,713 --> 00:02:12,913
- Appearance.

32
00:02:13,014 --> 00:02:16,014
- Yes. Kept hidden in the sealed cathedral

33
00:02:16,015 --> 00:02:19,615
deep inside the halls of the scum Hammerites.

34
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:22,316
Oh, but forgive me, you are, possibly,

35
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:24,817
'friendly' with the Order of the Hammer?

36
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:28,018
- No. Fanatics make unreliable friends.

37
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:31,619
- Excellent. I am prepared to offer you quite a sum.

38
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,820
A hundred thousand, upon receipt of The Eye.

39
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:38,221
- I don't see how I can refuse such an offer.

40
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:42,252
- Marvelous. Viktoria can fill you in on all the particulars.

41
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,700
And Mister Garrett...the sword. Keep it.

42
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:48,301
You have earned it. But also...

43
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:51,402
...I believe you'll find it useful in your quest.
