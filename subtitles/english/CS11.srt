1
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,300
- I can't tell you how pleased I am with you, Mister Garrett.

2
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:24,801
I simply can't find the words.

3
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:27,902
But perhaps Viktoria can help me in that regard.

4
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,203
She has such a way with them.

5
00:00:30,604 --> 00:00:33,904
- Yes, we are both so very pleased.

6
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:35,205
- Viktoria?

7
00:00:35,306 --> 00:00:37,906
- Even though The Eye is...defective.

8
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:38,907
- What?!?

9
00:00:39,508 --> 00:00:41,908
- Viktoria is quite right, Mister Garrett.

10
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:46,109
I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but this eye is completely blind..

11
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,310
- It's a rock. It's what you asked for. Am I gonna get paid or not?

12
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:52,611
- Of course.

13
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:56,412
- Viktoria, are you prepared to give Mister Garrett his...

14
00:00:56,813 --> 00:00:58,413
...Compensation?

15
00:01:05,614 --> 00:01:09,414
- Bow to the Woodsie Lord and offer up your flesheye

16
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:12,615
so that his Eye of Stone may see, Manfool!

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,616
Bids he then the spruces to singer him an anthems!

18
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:22,117
And the Woodsie Lord binders them fleshes to stone!

19
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,818
- Did you think those ancient phrases were mere words, Manfool?

20
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,519
Look at me!

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,920
I am The Woodsie Lord, The Trickster of legend!

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,900
If you be thirsty, fleshthing, drink of me.

23
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:47,701
If you be hungry, then feed for I am the honeymaker, and the jacksberry!

24
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:51,202
- He am the leaf that feeders on the fleshed ones.

25
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:56,403
Thems that calls themselves Builders and wielded up a hammers against him!

26
00:01:56,704 --> 00:02:01,404
- My poor Mister Garrett, you will not live to see the sprawling glory of it!

27
00:02:01,605 --> 00:02:04,605
- Your sacrifice is not yet complete!

28
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:10,106
Mine lilacs and mine thistleaids must feeds, and I?

29
00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:15,907
Stands He then in the greens and festered Maw

30
00:02:15,908 --> 00:02:22,008
and speeds He out his judgements upon the weeps and writhing manfools!
