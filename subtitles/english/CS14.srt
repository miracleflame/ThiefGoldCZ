1
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
- Pft, Keepers.

2
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:06,601
- So you think you've won.

3
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:11,202
- I think I've got my eye back..
- Yet, still, you are blind.

4
00:01:11,503 --> 00:01:15,803
- If you hadn't noticed, I just saved the world. Yourself included.

5
00:01:16,104 --> 00:01:18,604
- As we knew you would. As it had to be.

6
00:01:19,305 --> 00:01:21,505
- Now I remember why I left the Keepers.

7
00:01:21,606 --> 00:01:23,606
- And I remember why we let you go.

8
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:25,807
- What do you want from me?

9
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,000
You come to congratulate me?
Welcome me back to the fold?

10
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:33,001
- Very well. I will speak my piece plainly.

11
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:36,202
You have accomplished that which was written, and yes,

12
00:01:36,203 --> 00:01:37,603
you've done it well.

13
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:40,054
But there is no place for you with us any longer.

14
00:01:41,205 --> 00:01:44,205
Yet you will have a great need of us, and soon.

15
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:48,706
- I don't think so. I'm through with heroics.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,700
And with your kind as well.

17
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:53,801
- You cannot run from life as you did from us, Garrett.

18
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:56,102
Life has a way of finding you.

19
00:01:56,103 --> 00:01:58,503
No matter how artistic a sneak you are. 

20
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:02,704
Listen, there is a book that you were not made aware of.

21
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:07,105
I'm here to tell you that it would be wise for you to read it now,

22
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,706
if you can still read hieroglyphs.

23
00:02:09,707 --> 00:02:13,107
- I do try to forget, but you Keepers leave them everywhere for me.

24
00:02:13,108 --> 00:02:16,508
- Yes. You have more friends than you know.

25
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:19,709
- Tell my friends that I don't need their secret book.

26
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,510
Or their glyph warnings, or
their messengers.

27
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:26,111
Tell them I'm through. Tell them it's over.

28
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,612
Tell them Garrett is done.

29
00:02:31,913 --> 00:02:33,413
- I will tell them this:

30
00:02:33,914 --> 00:02:35,514
Nothing is changed,

31
00:02:35,914 --> 00:02:37,614
all is as it was written,

32
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:40,714
the Trickster is dead, beware the dawn of...

33
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:42,515
...the Metal Age.
