00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,300
Ye shall not rob from the house I have built,

2
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,800
or commit any theft or un-righteousness,

3
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,900
lest ye be struck down and driven into the earth forthwith,

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and the land of the heathen consume you.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the paths of thief and god are worn as one in the earth

7
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
THIEF wanted for the theft of the gems of Sarnoth

8
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,000
woe be to him that defies the tree, for he shall be cast out into the world through the veils of pain and fire
